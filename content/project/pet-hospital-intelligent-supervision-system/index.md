**Project Context**: The rise in living standards has seen pet ownership burgeon into a modern lifestyle choice. As economic growth accelerates and incomes soar, the number of pet owners has surged. China's pet market has expanded to several billion yuan and continues its growth trajectory. However, the advent of this booming industry has also highlighted significant challenges, particularly in accessing quality pet healthcare.

**Project Objective**: This research and development project aims to address the current gaps in service quality and information transparency within pet hospitals. By designing and deploying a mini-program based Pet Hospital Management System, the objective is to refine service efficiency, foster transparency in pet healthcare, and promote both healthy competition and regulation within the pet medical industry.

**Methodology**: Employing empirical research methods, the project synthesized information from literature reviews and market surveys to pinpoint technical solutions and methodologies. The system's development leveraged frameworks like Vue3, WeChat Mini-Program, and Django. A robust iterative development approach ensured continual refinement based on user feedback, culminating in a finalized and deployed system. System performance was then evaluated through rigorous testing and user feedback collection, providing avenues for further improvements.

**System Features**:

* **Product Purchasing**: A seamless platform for users to browse and purchase pet products.
* **Medical Appointments**: A streamlined booking interface for medical visits, reducing waiting times.
* **Registration & Queue Management**: Efficient management tools to handle registrations and queue systems.
* **Hospital Status Feedback**: Real-time updates on the pet hospital's operational status, ensuring owners are kept informed.
* **Live Monitoring**: A unique feature allowing pet owners to view real-time video feeds from the hospital, enhancing transparency and trust.

By leveraging the ubiquity and accessibility of mini-programs, the system facilitates constructive feedback mechanisms, empowering pet owners to engage in the oversight of these medical facilities, and thereby cultivating a healthier competitive and regulated pet medical industry.

**Contribution**: The project's core contribution lies in providing a comprehensive solution to address prevalent issues within pet medical services. It not only offers pet owners a more efficient and transparent healthcare experience but also fosters the positive development of the pet healthcare industry.
