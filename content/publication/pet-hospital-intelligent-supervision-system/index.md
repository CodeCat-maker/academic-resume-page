With the elevation of living standards, pet ownership has become an integral lifestyle for modern individuals. Given the economic growth and subsequent increase in individual incomes, the number of pet owners has surged, propelling China's pet market to a worth of several billion yuan, a figure that continues to rise. However, as the pet industry thrives, challenges associated with pet hospital visits become increasingly pronounced.

This paper addresses the existing issues of service quality and information transparency in pet hospitals. We propose the design and development of a pet hospital management system based on a mini-program. This system aims to enhance the efficiency and quality of pet medical services, promote transparency in pet medical services, and foster healthy competition and regulation within the pet medical industry. An empirical research methodology is adopted. Through literature review and market research, technical means and methods to address these issues are identified. Using frameworks for development, we engage in iterative improvements and optimizations, ultimately achieving system deployment. System performance and efficacy are evaluated through testing and user feedback, culminating in improvement suggestions and recommendations. A significant contribution of this research lies in offering an effective solution to challenges in pet hospital service quality and information transparency, thus availing pet owners of more convenient and efficient medical services for their pets and promoting the positive evolution of the pet medical industry.

The system offers features for product purchasing for dogs, medical appointment scheduling, registration queuing, hospital status feedback, and surveillance footage, thereby facilitating daily management for pet owners and enhancing the efficiency and quality of pet medical services. Additionally, this platform allows pet owners to stay updated on their pets' status within the hospital, fostering transparency in pet medical services. Leveraging the mini-program format, it provides pet owners with a mechanism to monitor and provide feedback on hospitals, thereby encouraging healthy competition and regulation in the pet medical industry.

From a computational research perspective, our study employs an empirical methodology. Through literature reviews and market surveys, we analyze the prevailing challenges in pet hospital service quality and information transparency, pinpointing technical means and methodologies to resolve these issues. The system's development will incorporate technologies and frameworks like Vue3, WeChat Mini Programs, and Django. Continuous iterations and optimizations based on user feedback and requirements will lead to the system's deployment. In conclusion, we will evaluate the system's performance and effectiveness via testing and user feedback, providing avenues for further enhancement.
