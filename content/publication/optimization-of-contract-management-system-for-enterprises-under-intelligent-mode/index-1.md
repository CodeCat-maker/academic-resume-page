  system can enhance the overall efficiency of contract management and the level
  of intelligent management. It significantly improves the accuracy of contract

  achieves data sharing. This enhancement boosts the company's risk control and
  management capabilities for contracts. It also elevates the convenience and
  efficiency of contract management in various business scenarios, bringing
  greater economic benefits to the enterprise. At the current stage, with the
  continuous development of intelligent technologies, various companies are
  comprehensively optimizing their contract management systems using smart
  technologies to boost contract management efficiency.
